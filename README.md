# H3C FIST REST API for java
The **H3C FIST REST API for java** in order to enable users to better use the REST interface for expansion and 
function improvement, this project describes how to use the encryption algorithm to encrypt the FIST original password,
so that can create sessions and complete subsequent REST interface requests.
Please refer to the example file in the docs document for the specific implementation method.

# Requirements
*	Intellij IDE or others
  *JAVA **1.8**
  *Maven **3.2.5**
